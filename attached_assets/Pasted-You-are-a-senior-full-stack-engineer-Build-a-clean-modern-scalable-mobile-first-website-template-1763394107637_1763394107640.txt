You are a senior full-stack engineer.
Build a clean, modern, scalable, mobile-first website template that will be initially configured for a business called “Grant Laundry & Dry Cleaning”, but architected so I can easily reuse and customize it for other businesses.

Business details for the first instance:

• Name: Grant Laundry & Dry Cleaning
• Industry: Laundry & Dry Cleaning Services
• Location: Lagos, Nigeria
• Primary CTA: “Schedule a Pickup”
• Contact channels: WhatsApp link, phone number, booking form
• Services: Laundry, Dry Cleaning, Ironing, Stain Removal, Express Service
• Opening hours: Mon–Sat (8 AM – 7 PM), Sun (12 PM – 5 PM)

Project Goals:

1. Build a scalable, reusable, theme-able template.


2. Business-specific data must be stored in one central config file so I can change the business name, services, colours, and contact details without touching components.


3. The layout, components, and styles must follow a modular architecture suitable for turning into a small multi-tenant SaaS later.



Technical Requirements:

1. Next.js (latest) + TypeScript


2. TailwindCSS for styling with a minimal clean design


3. Framer Motion for subtle animations


4. Component-based structure stored inside /components


5. Business configuration stored inside /config/business.ts


6. Theme customization stored inside /config/theme.ts


7. Utility hooks and helpers inside /lib


8. Fully responsive across screen sizes


9. Booking form with client-side validation (log data to console for now)



Pages/Sections to Implement:

• Hero section with CTA
• Services section (auto-populated from config file)
• Pricing section
• How It Works (steps)
• Testimonials placeholder
• Booking/Contact form
• Footer with contact info + map placeholder

Deliverables:

1. Full file and folder structure


2. All components implemented


3. A clean, reusable business config model


4. A theme system allowing me to swap colors, fonts, and accents easily


5. Instructions on how to customize and redeploy for a new business


6. All code in clean, copy-ready blocks



Optimize for clarity, reusability, and future expansion.
